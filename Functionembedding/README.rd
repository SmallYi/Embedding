1. FErun, according to the accelrate attributed network embedding paper, based on the first derived function of loss function equal 0,
we obtain the embedding by iteration. mainly run RNN.py.

2. based on proposed alogorithm 1, we obtain the embedding by iteration, mainly run FEG.py


two ways to get the function embedding
